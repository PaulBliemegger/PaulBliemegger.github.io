I have over 2 years of work experience as a frontend developer. As such, I worked on multiple projects with varying team sizes.
I gathered experience in Angular and React, while most of it was the latter, more recently with NextJS.

Additionally to my frontend experience, since last year I have implemented multiple LLM (such as ChatGPT) based projects for specific customer needs, working in the in-house AI team. These were done with Langchain and NestJ.

During, but especially at the end and after my studies, I have also started focusing more on Game Development.
My Bachelor's thesis was a VR climbing experience completely implemented in Unity and I have also worked on smaller projects in my own time, including Game Jams.

## Motivation

Ever since I started playing my first games I have always had a huge admiration for the worlds they brought to live. This led me to start studying Computer Science to create a basis of programming experience. I expressed that by working on smaller projects on my own and with friends throughout the years. The ultimate goal always being to create these worlds and experiences as a part of a motivated team.

At the end of my bachelors I decided to focus more on learning about Game Engineering by picking a Bachelor's Thesis fully written in Unity. The entire project is called “Vreeclimbing” and is a VR climbing experience. I used this chance to deepen my already existing knowledge of game programming, while also learning new skills.

I am currently working as a Web Developer, as this was a convenient way to earn money during the end of my studies. Through it, I managed to gather meaningful practical experience as a developer as a whole, but I also learned what it means to work in teams of varying sizes. I had to deal with fast changing requirements and new challenges on a daily basis, especially ever since I was part of the AI department from day one. Additionally, due to the necessity of adapting to new frameworks and tools on a regular basis, I have developed a proficiency in quickly acquainting myself with them.

As much as I have learned from my current job, it has also shown me that I finally want to commit to Game Development as my true passion. My favourite kind of work has always been to create amazing experiences, especially with people who are equally interested and I look back fondly to every opportunity that I had in the past.
