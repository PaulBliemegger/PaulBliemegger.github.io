## About me

I have over 2 years of work experience as a frontend developer. As such, I worked on multiple projects with varying team sizes.
I gathered experience in Angular and React, while most of it was the latter, more recently with NextJS.

Additionally to my frontend experience, since last year I have implemented multiple LLM (such as ChatGPT) based projects for specific customer needs, working in the in-house AI team. These were done with Langchain and NestJ.

During, but especially at the end and after my studies, I have also started focusing more on Game Development.
My Bachelor's thesis was a VR climbing experience completely implemented in Unity and I have also worked on smaller projects in my own time, including Game Jams.
